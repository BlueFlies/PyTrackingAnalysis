"""The Batch level (ADR-0009, ADR-0011): many Projects run unattended.

A Batch is structural — a directory with at least one Project anywhere
beneath it. Discovery is recursive and **prunes at each Project**: the walk
descends until it finds one — ``project.yaml`` plus at least one
experiment-shaped subdirectory — and never looks inside, because a Project's
subdirectories are its Experiments by definition. Grouping folders
(``Sept2026/``, ``Archive/2025/``) are therefore transparent, and a **Member**
is identified by its POSIX path relative to the Batch root (``Sept2026/ProjA``;
a top-level Project is just ``ProjA``, so existing ``batch.yaml`` files,
Removal Sheets, and API calls keep working unchanged).

Nothing marks a Batch: ``batch.yaml`` at its
root appears only once batch-level scripting is authored, because unlike a
Project a Batch has no authority to declare. A Batch Run executes one
designated Project Script in every Project (continue-on-error, per-Project
log prefixes) and its only product is the per-Project run summary — a Batch
never pools results across Projects.

There is no third script level: the thing a Batch Run runs IS a Project
Script, resolved per Project as batch.yaml ``project_scripts:`` → the
Project's own ``scripts:`` → the built-ins (Report Pipeline, Standard
Pipeline). With no designation at all each Project runs its OWN default
script — every ``project.yaml`` is created with one, so nothing is
silently substituted for a Project that has none.

   found, and — more importantly — where the Projects agree, where they
   disagree, and what the batch shows taken together. Give effect directions
   and magnitudes where the narratives state them.
2. **Experimental design problems.** Call out specific Projects whose design
   looks compromised: too few replicates, unbalanced or missing treatment
   groups, inconsistent factors or counting regions between replicates,
   replicates that were never analyzed.
3. **Heavy fly loss.** Name any Project or replicate where a large share of
   flies was excluded or flagged (low movement, quality cutoffs), give the
   numbers the narratives report, and say what it implies for trusting that
   Project's result.

Do not itemize minor per-Project or per-experiment detail — that lives in the
