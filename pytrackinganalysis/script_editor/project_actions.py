"""Project-level script actions (ADR-0006).

Project Scripts share the experiment-script language — ``{name,
steps:[{action, params}]}`` in ``project.yaml`` ``scripts:`` — but dispatch
through this separate registry with a :class:`ProjectRunContext`, so levels
cannot mix. The only bridge to experiment level is ``run_in_experiments``,
which runs a named Experiment Script in every replicate — or, with its
optional ``only:`` list of replicate directory names, in just those — (the
Project's central ``experiment_scripts:`` first, each replicate's own
``tracking_config.yaml`` as fallback — which also absorbs the legacy
``batch`` convention), continue-on-error with a failure summary.

Every other action is a thin wrapper over an existing ``Project`` method.
